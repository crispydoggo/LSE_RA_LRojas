# Preface {.unnumbered}

Nice to meet you! :)

I'm Lothar Mateo; I decided to present the results on this website to make understanding the code and analysis workflow easier.

You can consult the GitHub repository by clicking the </> icon at the left side of the page down the LSE logo. 

I hope you enjoy the report!
